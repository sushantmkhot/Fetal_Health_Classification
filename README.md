# Fetal_Health_Classification
Fetal Health Classification using Python for Data Analytics

I decided to choose this dataset having experienced the birth of my premature kid who is doing great today. 
I wanted to examine and study the dataset to understand what analysis we can do on the fetal health data. 

Tasks performed: 

Examine which features have strong correlation with Class label. 

Perform Classification Analysis and build models using :

    KNN Classifier (find optimal k and re-run to get the final accuracy)
    Logistic Regression classifier
    Naive Bayesian
    Decision Tree
    Random Forest 
    
    I have calculated and discussed Performance Metrics for these classifiers by preparing Confusion Matrix to look at how our prediction models perform. 
    
    I have Split Data into Training and Testing to verify the models built (50/50). 
    
    I also tried to visualize the dataset and look for features that can help for classification, outliers, correlation etc.
